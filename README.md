# CrimeStats
Crime data visualization project that combines FBI statistics with Mapbox to show relative crime bubbles across (most) of the 50 states from 2000 - 2018.

### User Story
As a consumer looking for a new state to move to, I want to know what crime is like in each state so I can choose a relatively safe state.

### Usage
Users must input a valid Mapbox API key (which will be stored on their machine for future sessions). Users may then choose the state, crime, and year before generating a map populated with relatively-sized crime bubbles
